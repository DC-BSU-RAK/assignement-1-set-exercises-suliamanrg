        <li>½ cup unsalted butter(100 g)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour(150 g)</li>

        <li>4 oz milk or sweet chocolate chunks(110 g)</li>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whisk the butter, salt, and sugars together in a large bowl until they are a smooth paste with no lumps.</li>
                <li>Whisk the egg and vanilla together and beat until light ribbons are formed that fall from the whisk and hold for a moment before falling back into the mixture.</li>
                <li>Add the flour and baking soda in and fold with a spatula (Don't overmix, which would toughen the gluten in the flour resulting in cookies that are more caky).</li>
                <li>Fold in the chocolate pieces, and then refrigerate the dough for a minimum of 30 minutes. To concentrate the toffee flavor and color, refrigerate overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li> Use an ice cream scoop to portion out the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, at least 4 inches (10 cm) apart and 2 inches (5 cm) away from pan edges so the cookies can spread.</li>
                <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until edges have just started to barely brown.</li>
                <li>Allow to cool completely before serving.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ul>
